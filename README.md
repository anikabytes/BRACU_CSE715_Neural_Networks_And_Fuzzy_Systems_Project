This project presents Stochastic Patch Graph Edge Contrastive Autoencoder (Stochastic PG-ECA), a non-deterministic unsupervised model for medical image analysis. By combining stochastic patch-level encodings, graph-based aggregation, and edge contrastive loss, the model improves robustness in representation learning, reconstruction, and generation tasks, outperforming traditional Variational Autoencoders under limited annotated data.
